Invoke this example like this:

    git clone git://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
    git clone git@github.com:wu-lee/ansible-users-usecase.git

    cd ansible-users-usecase
    . ../ansible/hacking/env-setup

Then either edit ansible_hosts to change "some.host.net" to a host you
can access, and run:

    ansible-playbook -i ansible_hosts --check -v users.yml

Or alternatively, if you don't have a host to run against, you can try
localhost.  Edit ansible_hosts, replacing "some.host.net" with
"localhost", and run:

    ansible-playbook -i ansible_hosts --check -v users.yml -c local

The --check paramter should prevent anything actually being changed,
whilst still showing the problem, which is that the create_userX.yml
task files (where "X" is A or B) get included but invoked only once
with a an $item value "${users}", rather than twice with $item values
"alice" and "bob".
